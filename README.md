core java + basics of java

This repository contains my Java Basic and Core programming exercises.
It includes simple to intermediate-level programs that helped me understand fundamental Java concepts — such as data types, loops, conditionals, classes, objects, arrays, strings, OOP principles, and more.
Each program is written with clear syntax and easy-to-understand logic, making it beginner-friendly and ideal for revision or quick reference.

📚 Learning Purpose
This repository is for practice and educational purposes.
It’s designed to strengthen your understanding of Core Java fundamentals before moving into Advanced Java or Java Full Stack Development (Servlets, JSP, Spring Boot, etc.).
